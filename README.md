# Dynamic Proxies Samples

## Benchmarks

To exercise the benchmarks, run the following in a terminal:

 1. mvn clean install
 2. mvn verify -DskipTests -Prun-benchmarks
 
The first command will install the JAR for the core project in your local Maven
 repository. The second command will use the core JAR to run the benchmarks.

The forking required by JMH does not work when running the benchmarks using the
 Maven plugin in IntelliJ IDEA 2019.2.4.
 
A note about creating a JPMS (Java) module for the benchmarks.
 This does not work because there is a package clash between jmh-core and 
 jmh-generator-annprocess which prevents them being loaded as automatic modules
 at the same time.  jmh-core has a package `org.openjdk.jmh.generators.core`
 which clashes with `org.openjdk.jmh.generators` in jmh-generator-annprocess.
